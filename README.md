# ðŸš€ Career Transition Plan  

This repository documents my structured journey to transition into a **Data Engineering / Data Analyst role** from my current Tableau Server Admin background.  

Iâ€™m following a **6-month plan** (SQL + Python + Projects + Cloud) with weekly milestones, practice problems, and projects.  
The goal: **Get a role in data domain by end of 2025.**
