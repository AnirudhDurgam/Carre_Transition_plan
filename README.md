# Transition Journey ðŸš€

This repo documents my learning path as I transition from Tableau Server Admin â†’ Data Engineering.  
Iâ€™m following a 6-month structured plan (SQL, Python, ETL, Airflow, Cloud).  

## Sections
- **SQL/** â†’ LeetCode SQL interview prep
- **Python/** â†’ Basics + pandas/numpy practice
- **Projects/** â†’ Small ETL and pipeline projects

Each week Iâ€™ll update with new solved problems and mini projects.
